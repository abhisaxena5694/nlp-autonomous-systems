opendoor.py is a program that emulates the opening an closing of a door.

I have considered that the door has two states.
-Opened
-Closed

The opened state is  represented by logic 1
The closed state is represented by logic 0

We need to give natural language commands so that the state of the door changes i.e. it opens if it is closed and vice versa.

The natural language commands for opening the door can be -
"open door"
"open the door"
"please open the door"
"can you open the door?"

Similar commands can be used for the closing of the door.
