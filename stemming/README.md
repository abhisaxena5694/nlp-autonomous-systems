Stemming-
	Stemming is a process of reducing inflected words to their word stems.

Inflections-
	Inflection is the name for the extra letter or letters added to nouns, verbs and adjectives in their different gramatical forms. eg. -ly, -ful, -ed, -ies.

Inflected words-
	Words with added inflections are called inflected words. eg: playful, played, playing, plays

Stems-
	Words to which inflections are added are called stems. 
	eg: The stem of 'playful', 'played', 'playing' and 'plays' will be 'play'.





I have taken four stemming algorithms-
	- Porter
	- Porter2
	- Paicehusk
	- Lovin

The task is to determine accuracy of the four stemming algorithm.

Procedure-
1. Take a data set of inflected words.
2. Take a set of corresponding stems of the inflected words.
3. Derive a list of stems using a stemming algorithm.
4. Calculate accuracy of the stemmer.
